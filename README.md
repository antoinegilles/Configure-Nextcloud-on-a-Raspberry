This tutorial explains the command lines to install to install NextCloud (a cloud storage) on your raspberry.
Do not hesitate to inform yourself about the ssh connection in order to configure your raspberry remotely.

Here is the link for the connection in ssh : https://the-raspberry.com/ssh-raspberry-pi

three files present:
- install.sh (enumerates the order lists to be performed on a terminal)
- source.txt (the sources that helped us to make this tutorial)

ZSH is part of the order lists, you can ignore this step, it concerns the installation of a new terminal on your raspberry, this is optional.
